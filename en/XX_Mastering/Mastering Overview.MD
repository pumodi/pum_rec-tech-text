# Mastering
* Balance the sonic elements of a stereo mix and optimize it for playback across all systems and formats.
* An easy way to think of mastering is putting the icing on the cake, the finish that you put on a carpentry project.
* It cannot improve what is not already there but it can take a mix and make it cohesive, finished.
* The main reason we do this, nowadays, is to ensure that a mix is represented its best on as many platforms as possible.
* Traditionally, mastering was meant to prepare a mix, and all other mixes on a record, for release, typically on cd.

## What's the difference
* Mixing gets all the individual parts of a song working as one. Taking all the parts and slotting them into place.

* Mastering is puts the shine on the mix. After the mix is all said and done, we take that stereo file and give it that last little push into brilliance.

## Steps to mastering
* Restoration and Repair: If there are any issues with the audio, like clicks and pops, those are fixed before we move on.
* Stereo Enhancing: Used to tighten up low end and provide a wide sound to your mix.
* EQ: Corrects spatial imbalances and enhances elements that need to stand out. Generally, the goal here is to provide proportional balance. Nothing sticking out too much.
* Compression: In this case, we use compression to provide uniformity to the mix.
* Loudness: After compression, we limit the track and boost it to make it competitively loud. We must be careful not to overdo this step.
* Bit Depth Reduction & Sample Rate Conversion (Dithering): This is where the raw stereo output from the mastering desk is taken, converted down to the appropriate formats, and prepped for release.
* Sequencing: If you have multiple tracks, this is where they would be timed and placed onto a master media. For example, CD or Vinyl.
