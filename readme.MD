# The Pumodi Approach to Recording Engineering

This github repo represents the open source version of my textbook on Recording Engineering. The content found here is the same content as the textbook, albeit without diagrams, imagery, or audio content. It is my hope that this repository will prove useful to recording students around the world.

## Open Source Translation

I would love to have this repo translated from English to other languages. If you are interested in translating, feel free to fork the repo and submit a pull request once you are finished. Alternatively, shoot me an email at jeff@jeffbricemusic.commonly

Translations will never be used in the print version of the textbook without the author first contacting and negotiating usage of said translations. By submitting a translation to this repo, you are consenting to release said translation as open source.
